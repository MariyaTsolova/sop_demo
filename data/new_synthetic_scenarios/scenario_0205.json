    "action": "The teacher aide initially yelled at M to stop screaming and tried to forcibly lead him away from the playground, ignoring his distress. Other students watched and began to gather around, adding to M's upset.",
    "effect": "M's distress escalated further due to the loud reprimand and crowd, and it took a considerable amount of time for M to calm down after being removed to a quieter space. The ineffective approach prolonged the disturbance to other students and heightened M's sensory overload.",
