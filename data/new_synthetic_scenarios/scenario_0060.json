    "situation": "S becomes distressed when transitioning from the classroom to the gym for physical education class. He often covers his ears and refuses to leave the room.",
    "action": "A soothing voice was used to talk to S. The teacher aide showed him a picture schedule, highlighting the gym activity as fun and something he can leave at any point if it becomes overwhelming. S was also offered noise-canceling headphones and a choice of a tangible motivator upon returning to the classroom.",
    "effect": "S initially resisted, but calmed down with the continuous encouragement and visual cue. The headphones helped minimize sensory overload, and S slowly gained confidence to make the transition with his aide. These measures improved S's transition experience, creating a more positive association with the gym.",
