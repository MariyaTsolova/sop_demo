    "situation": "S began to shut down when asked to read aloud in class, fearing embarrassment from her peers due to her dyslexia-related difficulties.",
    "action": "The TA intervened by offering S an alternative way to participate, such as reading a smaller section quietly to her. She praised S for her effort, and they tried some multisensory reading techniques together during break time. This led S to become more comfortable with reading aloud in controlled settings.",
    "effect": "S felt supported and less anxious about reading tasks, gradually becoming more confident. This approach allowed her to improve her reading skills and reduced her fear of peer judgment.",
